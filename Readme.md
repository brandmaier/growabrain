Grow a brain!
============


### About

Grow a brain is a generative simulation of randomly generated cells that interact based on three simple rules:

- Neighboring cells stay at a preferred distance to each other (ATR=attraction rate, NDI=preferred distance)
- Other cells are repulsed if too close (REP=repulsion)
- All cells move outwards from the center
